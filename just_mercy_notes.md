Traffic stops are a weird power dynamic. There is a person out there who can just upend your entire day, maybe your life, if they feel like it. Not even elected. Just another regular human being who might be having a bad day can just ruin everything up for you. Of course I don't know what it feels like. I'm white and that makes me a threat to retaliate. Of course black people get subjected to this more.

Prison Guard / Prisoner power dynamic is also terrible. We systemically devalue people, strip them of their humanity, and then offer jobs of influence and power to people who are often drawn to positions of power because they are violent or without empathy. This is setup to be terrible for prisoners.

Prison industrial complex is modern day slavery. The entire system is set up to feed cheap labor into it and it targets the poor, or those without power, because it's been working since the beginning of time, and there aren't enough people fighting it to make those within it feel bad about what they're doing.

Slavery was abolished but financial inequality has never been addressed. Oppressed people with no wealth were released into a capitalist country and told to pull themselves up by their own boot straps.  When they started to, white people massacred them in the Tulsa riots of 1921. I never knew this happened until I saw it in Watchmen (HBO series) and I actually thought it was a work of fiction. When I found out it was real, I was flabbergasted. This movie is about families who were never able to gain anything to be taken from them except for their freedom.

Bryan Stevenson getting strip searched was a metaphor for slave trades. Doesn't matter who you are or who you think you are. If your skin isn't white, it might as well be a striped suit to these prison guards.

Bryan Stevenson interviewing prisoners is a reminder that our public defense system is setup to fail. Underpaid lawyers with too many caseloads can't fight. It's part of the feeder system. Defendants are told to take plea bargains instead of fight because the system is so racist, they'll probably lose in court anyway, even if they are innocent.

"They can call it what they want. This is just another way to lynch a black man."

Black families have to talk to their kids about heinous stuff white kids are completely sheltered from.

"I know you didn't kill Rhonda Morrison." — This is the point where I started wondering how many murderers are walking free because it was easier — or looks better in the statistics — to convict someone that was innocent and powerless to defend themselves rather than try to find the truth.

"I deserve what's coming" —Herb. Combat veterans treated like trash in this country, too. My Dad had PTSD, never treated for it. Got out of Vietnam and then got released right into a family. My whole family felt the reverberations from that war. My Dad's white. What's that like for a black man who had been through even worse?

Darnell — witness intimidation. Police and DA work too closely together for too long. Good ol boys network is real and bad.

DA is incentivized to not consider reconsidering.

"Why did you stop me" — "We're letting you go, you should be happy." — Another thing I'm never going to have to deal with. That's terrifying.

When he listened to the tape and it proved the testimony was coerced, I felt anxiety for the lawyer. That's probably a real fear people feel when upsetting the status quo.

"First time in a chamber? Don't think too much, you'll lose your shit." — Metaphor for white culture as a whole. Distract and deflect.

Do they actually play gospel music for everyone else in the prison when someone's walking to die? That's messed up.

Always seemed weird for me that deeply religious places would be okay with normal men stepping into God's path to impose limits on someone's mortal ability to repent.

When the first judge decided to not grant a mistrial, I thought, "Yeah that's about right." Expected the outcome because it was based on a true story. The real system usually doesn't provide justice often enough to not be cynical.

Reversals or releases for 140 death row convictions. Holy shit.

This all starts with police. They start the snowball of injustice rolling and sometimes, they are bad people. When that snowball can roll towards an innocent person's life being destroyed, one bad apple is too many.

- License police like hairdressers and doctors.
    - Require a 2 year degree.
- Remove their qualified immunity.
    - Used to cover up crimes for too many people. It makes sense, but it's abused to create too many blatant miscarriages of justice.
- Demilitarize local police departments. Make them look uncool. If they can't handle teenagers making fun of their shorts, they shouldn't be in that position.
- Make them carry insurance to cover their mistakes like doctors do for malpractice.
    - Can't afford insurance anymore? Can't be a cop.
- Always-on body cams with blind redundancy storage of footage. Federally funded if necessary.
    - I.E. Body cam films and stores to the cloud outside of the influence of their respective departments.
- We've trusted police to police themselves for too long. It doesn't work. We need to force accountability on them.
